# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the compilation errors in PlayerViewModel.kt related to missing video export functionality. The errors indicate that the video export feature references (`exportEvent` and `exportVideoClip`) are missing from the VideoRepository, causing build failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PlayerViewModel to compile successfully, so that the video player app can be built and deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PlayerViewModel is compiled THEN the system SHALL resolve all references to exportEvent
2. WHEN the PlayerViewModel is compiled THEN the system SHALL resolve all references to exportVideoClip
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL complete without compilation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export video clips from the player, so that I can save selected portions of videos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a loop range in the player THEN the system SHALL enable the export functionality
2. WHEN I trigger video export THEN the system SHALL process the video clip in the background
3. WHEN the export completes THEN the system SHALL notify me of the result
4. IF the export fails THEN the system SHALL provide an error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for video export operations, so that the app remains stable during export failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video export encounters an error THEN the system SHALL handle the exception gracefully
2. WHEN export operations fail THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages
3. WHEN export is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide status updates to the UI
