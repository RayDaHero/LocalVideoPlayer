# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update ExoPlayer control timeout configuration





  - Modify custom_player_control.xml to increase show_timeout from 5000ms to 10000ms
  - Add proper controller configuration attributes for better control behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [ ] 2. Create ControlVisibilityManager class







  - Implement ControlVisibilityManager class with methods for managing control visibility states
  - Add enum for ControlVisibilityState (AUTO_HIDE, ALWAYS_VISIBLE, CUSTOM_MODE)
  - Create data class for ControlVisibilityConfig with timeout and animation settings
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement user interaction detection system




  - Add touch event listeners to PlayerView to detect user interactions
  - Implement onUserInteraction() method that resets control visibility timer
  - Add callback system for control interactions to reset timer
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 4. Add context-aware control visibility management


  - Implement updateControlsVisibilityForCustomPanel() method in PlayerActivity
  - Add logic to keep controls visible when custom controls panel is open
  - Implement setCustomControlsMode() to manage visibility during loop setting
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 5. Optimize memory cleanup operations to prevent UI interference


  - Modify cleanupThumbnails() to run on background thread
  - Update memory cleanup calls in lifecycle methods to be non-blocking
  - Remove aggressive System.gc() calls that might interfere with UI responsiveness
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 6. Fix touch event conflicts between controls



  - Update layout positioning to prevent control overlap issues
  - Implement proper touch event propagation between PlayerView and custom controls
  - Add touch event handling to prevent conflicts during thumbnail interactions
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 7. Integrate ControlVisibilityManager with PlayerActivity


  - Initialize ControlVisibilityManager in PlayerActivity onCreate()
  - Connect custom controls panel visibility changes to control manager
  - Update toggleCustomControlsPanel() to coordinate with video controls
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Add smooth control animations and transitions


  - Implement fade animations for control visibility changes
  - Add smooth transitions when switching between visibility modes
  - Ensure animations don't conflict between different control types
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.4_

- [x] 9. Implement memory-safe looping logic optimization



  - Modify updateLoopingState() to avoid interfering with control visibility
  - Optimize loop handler frequency to reduce UI thread interference
  - Add proper cleanup of handlers that doesn't affect control responsiveness
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 10. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery


  - Implement fallback mechanisms for unresponsive control states
  - Add error recovery for ExoPlayer control visibility issues
  - Create graceful degradation for memory pressure scenarios
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.4_

- [ ] 11. Create unit tests for ControlVisibilityManager



  - Write tests for control visibility state transitions
  - Test timer reset functionality and user interaction detection
  - Add tests for memory-safe operations and UI thread safety
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 12. Add integration tests for control coordination




  - Test ExoPlayer control integration with custom visibility management
  - Verify custom controls panel interaction with video controls
  - Test control behavior under various app states and memory conditions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2_
