# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the issue where the video player controls in the Local Video Player app disappear randomly and too quickly, making it difficult for users to interact with the video playback controls. The current implementation has a 5-second auto-hide timeout that is too aggressive, and there are potential conflicts between the custom overlay controls and ExoPlayer's built-in control visibility management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user watching a video, I want the video player controls to remain visible for a reasonable amount of time so that I can easily access play/pause and other controls without having to tap the screen frequently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts playing a video THEN the video controls SHALL remain visible for at least 10 seconds
2. WHEN a user interacts with any control THEN the control visibility timer SHALL reset to the full duration
3. WHEN a user taps on the video area THEN the controls SHALL become visible if they are hidden
4. WHEN controls are visible THEN they SHALL fade out smoothly after the timeout period

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to keep video controls always visible when I'm actively using loop controls or other advanced features so that I don't lose access to essential playback controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the custom controls panel is open THEN the video player controls SHALL remain visible
2. WHEN a user is setting loop points THEN the video controls SHALL not auto-hide
3. WHEN the custom controls panel is closed THEN normal auto-hide behavior SHALL resume
4. WHEN a user is interacting with thumbnails THEN the video controls SHALL remain visible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the video player controls to respond reliably to my touch interactions without being affected by background processes or memory management operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app performs memory cleanup THEN video control responsiveness SHALL not be affected
2. WHEN thumbnail generation is in progress THEN video controls SHALL remain responsive
3. WHEN custom looping logic is active THEN it SHALL not interfere with control visibility
4. WHEN the app is under memory pressure THEN video controls SHALL still function properly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent behavior where video controls don't conflict with custom overlay controls and both sets of controls work harmoniously together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom controls are visible THEN they SHALL not block touch events to video controls
2. WHEN video controls are visible THEN they SHALL not interfere with custom control interactions
3. WHEN both control sets are visible THEN they SHALL be positioned to avoid visual overlap
4. WHEN transitioning between control states THEN animations SHALL be smooth and non-conflicting
